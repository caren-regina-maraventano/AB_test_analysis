Analysis of the results of an A/B test conducted on an e-commerce mobile website, which consisted in the placement of a banner highlighting products from a growing category, to determine if it would lead to an increase in revenue.

I had to perform sanity checks, EDA, and metrics analysis where I calculated p-values to assess whether there was a difference between the control and test groups, then I calculated the confidence intervals to determine the range of possible values within which the true difference between the groups may lie, and finally established if this was practically significant. Based on these findings, I provided recommendations and suggested next steps to follow.
